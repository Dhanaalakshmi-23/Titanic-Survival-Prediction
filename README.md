# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Overview
The Titanic Survival Prediction project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic based on various features such as age, gender, class, and fare. This project utilizes data analysis and machine learning techniques to gain insights into the factors that influenced survival rates during the tragic event.

## Features
- **Data Exploration**: Analyze and visualize the Titanic dataset to understand the relationships between features and survival.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implement different models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest) to predict survival.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of each model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **User Interface**: A simple interface to input passenger details and predict survival chances.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for data analysis and model building.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
- **Flask** (if applicable): For creating a web interface to make predictions.
